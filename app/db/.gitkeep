# This file is intentionally blank. It's a placeholder to ensure this directory is tracked by Git.
# Git by default does not track empty directories. Adding a .gitkeep file (or any other file)
# inside an otherwise empty directory allows the directory structure to be versioned.
# This is a common convention, though not an official Git feature.

# Feel free to delete this file once you add other files to this directory.
